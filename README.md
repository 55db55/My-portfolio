Welcome to my testing portfolio!

This repository demonstrates my skills and experience in manual, automation and security testing. 

Below, you will find examples of bug reports, test cases, and automation scripts.

Using the Juice Shop website (https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#) as an example, I will present my approach to testing websites and describe examples of bugs I found. 

The following table provides a thematic description of these examples.

My examples do not exhaust the number of bugs present on the Juice Shop website, but they are an example of my testing method.

Additionally, I am attaching sample automated tests written in Playwright and Cypress. I am including these sample tests with the consent of my employer.
