Welcome to my testing portfolio!

This repository demonstrates my skills and experience in manual, automation and security testing. 

Below, you will find examples of bug reports, test cases, and automation scripts.

Using the Jucie Shop website (https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com/#) as an example, I will present my approach to testing websites and describe examples of bugs I found. 

They will be described thematically in the table below.

My examples do not exhaust the number of bugs present on the Juice Shop website, but they are an example of my testing method.
